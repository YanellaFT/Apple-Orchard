Apple Orchard
---
Play this game to create your own (virtual) apple pie! 

Apple Orchard is a step-by-step mini-game where your goal is simple: bake the perfect apple pie from scratch. Pick apples, mix ingredients, and bake your cake in a series of fun mini-games. Each step is interactive.

This idea for a game came to me as I was thinking how to make a collecting game more fun. Expanding on the idea of collecting apples for a cause developed into this multi-mini game story project. I made this project using the p5.js library. One thing I struggled with was being able to drag and drop the ingredients into the bowl. 

All backgrounds are digitally drawn by myself. The end screen gif and sprite images were taken from google images.
